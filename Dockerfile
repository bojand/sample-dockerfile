# This is a standard Dockerfile for building a Go app.
# It is a multi-stage build: the first stage compiles the Go source into a binary, and
#   the second stage copies only the binary into an alpine base.

# -- Stage 1 -- #
# Compile the app.

# The build context is set to the directory where the repo is cloned.
# This will copy all files in the repo to /app inside the container.
# If your app requires the build context to be set to a subdirectory inside the repo, you
#   can use the source_dir app spec option, see: https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/references/app-specification-reference/
